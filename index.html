  <!-- remember to use semantic tags (main, article, header, etc) from module 1 stuff -->
  <!-- thinking layout should be a title, some directions, and then some space -->
  <!-- after space, have an input box and a button -->
  <!-- after button, maybe have some blank boxes that will get filled up with the recipes? recipe cards lol -->
  <!-- or, maybe look into material/botstrap and see if i can get a neat flippable recipe card thing working!! -->
</body>

<!-- script here i think, gotta double check -->
